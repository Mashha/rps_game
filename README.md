# Rock, Paper, and Scissors game

## Introduction
This game was the first “complex” project I made with javascript. You can play five rounds of this game with the computer. I made my own design in figma and I have also added an option for different background image. I really like summer, how about you? 
I made this game quite fast in the console and it was a bit more challenging when I started to connect it with the DOM.
It is mobile friendly. 

## Technologies
Skills I used: 
- HTML,
- CSS, 
- JavaScript, and
- Figma

## Improvements
The one thing I would like to add here would be to save scores of a few rounds, which the player can also check. 

## Source
